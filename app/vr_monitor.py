"""Background thread that polls SteamVR (via OpenVR) for connected devices
and their battery state.

Devices are keyed by serial number (stable across reboots/reconnects) rather
than tracked-device index (which SteamVR can reassign), so a saved overlay
item keeps pointing at "your right controller" even if SteamVR renumbers it.

Each poll also checks for a small external "fake signal" file (see
paths.fake_signal_path() / tools/fake_vr_signal_simulator.py) before touching
real OpenVR at all - if it exists and was written recently, its devices are
used for that cycle instead of real hardware, so a separate standalone tool
can feed this app fake devices for demos/testing. No file, or a stale one
(the simulator closed/crashed) -> falls straight back to real SteamVR, same
as always.
