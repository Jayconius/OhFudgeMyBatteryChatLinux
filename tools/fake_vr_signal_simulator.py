"""Standalone fake-SteamVR signal emitter for demo recordings/testing.

This is a genuinely separate, lightweight tool - it does NOT launch a copy
of the main app. It just writes a small heartbeat file that a REAL, already-
running OhFudgeMyBatteryChat.exe (v1.2.0+) reads instead of real OpenVR
data, whenever that file exists and was updated within the last few
seconds - see vr_monitor.py's _read_fake_signal(). Close this tool (or let
it stop updating) and the real app falls back to actual SteamVR on its own,
no restart needed.

Run this ALONGSIDE the real app - drop this exe in the same folder as
OhFudgeMyBatteryChat.exe so both share one Data folder automatically, then
just start both. Or run from source:

    python tools/fake_vr_signal_simulator.py [--data-dir PATH]

Always shows the same generic placeholder rig - a Headset, two Controllers,
five Trackers (hip, both feet, both knees - a typical 5-point full body
tracking setup), three Lighthouses/base stations (connect/disconnect only,
no battery - matching real hardware), and the SteamVR Service pseudo-device
itself (also connect/disconnect only) - regardless of what's configured in
the real app, so they're always there to demo/test against instead of
disappearing once you remove the last Device/Effect that referenced them.
Point real Device/Effect items at DEMO-HMD-01/DEMO-CTRL-L/DEMO-CTRL-R/
DEMO-TRACKER-01..05/DEMO-LIGHTHOUSE-01..03 from the app's own Add screens to
drive those; the SteamVR Service row drives the same pseudo-device the real
app synthesizes on its own from steamvr_connected when nothing is simulated
(see vr_monitor.STEAMVR_SERVICE_SERIAL) - unchecking it here simulates
SteamVR crashing/closing without touching any other device.
